    <div id="intro">
        <p>When I attempt to describe Pink Floyd's music, I stop short of classifying it as "rock", "pop", or anything
            even similar.</p>       
        
        <p>Rather, I believe they are in a class all their own.</p>

        <p>Why do I see them this way, you ask?</p>

        <p>Well, it's because I don't just listen to their music, I <em>FEEL</em> it.</p>

        <h3>A Momentary History</h3>

        <p>It was the early Sixties, and the world was changing.  A group of talented guitar playing teenagers had found their ways from Cambridge to London to immerse themselves in the experiences
            of art, architecture, and music.  The future-seeking Roger Waters, Roger "Syd" Barrett, and David Gilmour were eager to mix with other like-minded artists in the big city.
            It was there, in 1965, that they met their future bandmates Nick Mason and Rick Wright, an experimental percussionist and gifted keyboardist, respectively.

        />


        <p>I'd like to say that from there they played happily ever after, but alas, that was not the case.</p>
       
        <p>After 3 years with a self-destructive, mentally fragile, Syd Barrett at the helm, the band sadly couldn't take anymore.  He was eventually replaced by the newly returned David Gilmour who had been
            abroad.  Thus, beginning the next chapter of the Floyd which propelled the band to an almost mythical status in the music world.</p>

            <h3>Money on The Wall</h3>

                <p id="wall">As one of the most commercially successful and influential bands of all time, Pink Floyd has sold over 250 million records worldwide.</p>

                <p id="wall">Just a saucerful of their accolades include:</p>
                
                <em>Rolling Stone's</em> 500 Greatest Albums of All Time(2003):
                    <ul>

                        <li><em>The Wall</em> (#87)</li>
                        <li><em>Wish You Were Here</em> (#209)</li>

                    </ul>

                

                <ul><strong><em>Rolling Stone's</em> 500 Greatest Songs of All Time(2004):</strong>

                    </ul>
                
                </ul>
            
        <p>As if that wasn't impressive enough, this experimentally psychadelic band with a knack for philosophical lyrics and elaborate live shows was <a href="https://www.rockhall.com/inductees/pink-floyd">inducted into the US Rock and Roll Hall of
            Fame in 1996."</a></p>
